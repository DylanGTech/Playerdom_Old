# Playerdom
Proof-of-concept multiplayer RPG with advanced NPC AI and randomly-generated worlds.
Stage: Classic

**An overview of each project in the solution:

**Playerdom.Server**: .NET Core command that runs the multiplayer game server on the host machine at port 25565 (arbitrarily set to Minecraft Java Edition default's port for the time being). Logs debug info on the console until the host user terminates it by pressing a key

**Playerdom.UWP/Playerdom.Win32**: Contains platform-specific startup code for the Universal Windows Platform, and classic Win32 applications, respectively

**Playerdom.Shared**: A MonoGame project containing the majority of code used to run on the client and the server. Platform-specific code is seperated and substituted by preprocessor directives

**PngToPldms**: A .NET Core command that converts PNG schematics into the Playerdom Structure format (pldms), a custom file type that can be loaded into the game when generating worlds
